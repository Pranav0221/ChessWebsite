		<h1><u><b>
					<center>The Rules of the Game</center></u></b></h1>

		<h3>One player plays with the white pieces and the other player plays with the black pieces. White gets to move
			first and then the players alternate moves. The game ends either in a draw or with one
			player checkmating the other and winning the game. The players can also agree
			to a draw in the middle of a game or one player can resign (give up) if he
			knows he will lose.
			<br><br>

			The game is generally divided into three phases: the opening, the middlegame, and the
			endgame. In the opening, you want to move your pieces out to good
			squares in preparation for the middlegame. You also want to make sure your king is safe, usually by
			castling.
			In the middlegame, players fight for the advantage and sometimes try to checkmate each other. In the
			endgame, promoting pawns is usually
			the goal players aim for.

		<h3>

			<dl><u><b>
						<center>Check</center>
					</b></u></dl>

			<dl>
				<p> Check is when you move a piece so that it threatens to take your opponent's
					king the next turn. Your opponent must stop the check by either moving their king, blocking the
					check
					with another piece, or capturing the piece that is checking. </p>
			</dl>

			<dl><u><b>
						<center> Checkmate</center>
					</b> </u></dl>

			<dl>
				<p>Checkmate occurs when one player is threatening to take their opponent's king
					and their opponent cannot prevent it by making a legal move. If you checkmate your opponent, you
					win.
				</p>
			</dl>

			<dl><u><b>
						<center> Draws </center>
					</b></u></dl>

			<dl>
				<p> There are four ways a draw can happen.</p>
			</dl>

			<ol>
				<li>The players can agree to a draw. </li>
				<li>Three move repetition. That is when the exact same position occurs on the board three times.</li>
				<li>Stalemate. Stalemate occurs when one player has no legal move on their turn
					and they are not in check.</li>
				<li> The 50 move rule.
					That is when 50 moves are made without a pawn moving or a piece being captured. </li>
			</ol>

		<h1><u><b>
					<center> The Board and the Pieces </center></u></b></h1>

		<h3> A chessboard has 64 squares that alternate black (dark) and white (light). The rows are called 'ranks' and
			are
			numbered from 1 to 8. The white pieces start on the first and second ranks while the black pieces start on
			the seventh
			and eighth ranks. The columns are called "files" and are ordered from 'a' to 'h'. The a file is on white's
			left
			and black's right.
			<br>

			Each player has eight pawns, two rooks, two knights,
			two bishops, one queen, and one king. Knights and bishops are called minor pieces while rooks and the queen
			are called major pieces.
			<br><br>

			The pieces are arranged like this:

									Pawns can move one square forward
									unless they are on their starting square, in this case they can move either one or
									two squares forward. But they capture other pieces by moving diagonally forward to
									the left or right.
									<b>Promotion :</b>If your pawn reaches the back rank of your opponent, it
									promotes immediately into any other piece of your choice.
									<b>en passant :</b> This move can only be performed by a white pawn on the
									fifth rank or a black
									pawn on the fourth rank.

							</td>

							<td>
								<p class="border" ; font-size: 30px> Knights are a minor piece .
									They move in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction
									and one square left or right. Unlike pawns, they can move in any direction. They
									also have the unique ability
									of being able to jump over other pieces. This allows knights to reach squares that
									might be hard for other
									pieces to get to. They are
									therefore most effective in
									the middle of the board.

								</figure>
							</td>

							<td>
								<p class="border" ; font-size: 30px> Bishops are a minor piece like knights. They move
									diagonally in any
									direction, for any
									number of squares. Bishops can only move on squares of one color but they
									have a long range. In an open position, bishops can attack
									squares on both sides of the board. A pair of bishops can be a powerful force.

							</td>

							<td>
								<p class="border" ; font-size: 30px> Rooks are a major piece.
									They move in a straight line for any number of squares. As the game
									goes on, rooks become more powerful as pieces are traded and the board opens up.
									They play their most active role in the endgame.Rooks work best on open files, where
									their full range is utilized. Doubling up rooks (putting one in front of the other
									on the same file) is a
									powerful attacking tool.

							<td>
								<p class="border" ; font-size: 30px> The queen
									is the most powerful piece on the board. Able to move both diagonally and in
									straight lines.. The
									queen can attack multiple pieces at the same time and

							</td>

							<td>
								<p class="border" ; font-size: 30px> The king is the most important piece of the game.
									If you let it get checkmated, than you lose. That is why many games revolve around
									attacking your opponent's king while defending you own.
									The king can move one square in any direction.
