			<td>
				<p class="border" ; font-size: 30px> Rooks play a part in an important special move
					along with the king: castling. You can castle either to the kingside or the
					queenside. In order
					to castle, a few conditions must be met. First, you cannot be in check. Second, your
					king and whichever rook you castle with must not have moved
					during the entire game up to that point. Third, there must be no pieces in between
					the king and castling rook. In addition, you cannot "castle through check"
					which means that no enemy piece can be
					threatening either of the two squares that the king moves through.
					Castling is a very important move which is played by both sides in the vast majority
					of games. It gets your king to safety
					on the side of the board and centralizes a rook at the same time.

				<p class="border"> In the endgame, especially if each side only has a rook or minor pieces, king
					activity is very
					important. The king becomes an important attacking piece and king activity can be the difference
